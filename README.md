Analysis:

In the dataset, the variation between mean and median is small, which suggests that the data is not skewed. 
In an average study the standard error of the mean, SEM is a measure of how far the study mean is from the population mean. A small value of SEm givens an indication of narrow distribution. This could mean more precise estimate of the population. 

Total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen is relatively consistent, except for Capomulin and Ramicane.For these Regimen it is higher.

When looking at specific regimen, Capomulin, the visualisation suggest a decrease of the tumor volume at the highest timepoint. When looking at the correlation between weight and tumor volume for the same regimen, the calculation suggests a weak relationship.
